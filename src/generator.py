# Telegram Auto Kicklist
#
# A small tool, that generates a list with kicked/banned users, their id
# and reason from a telegram group for exactly that purpose.
#
# Messages must look like:
#
#    "@username - reason"
#
# This tool automatically grabs the user id behind the username, so username-
# changes will be detected.
